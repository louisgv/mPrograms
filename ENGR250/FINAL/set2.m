% Interpolation and Numerical Differentiation

% The value of splines
% In class we discussed the value of splines and how they 
% do more than make a graph look pretty. 

% The purpose of this problem is to provide an example of the value 
% of splines by combining several things we have now learned.

% We are going to examine y = sin(x) and 
% its derivatives based on coarse data. 
% Let
xCoarse = 0:0.5:5;
%  and
yCoarse = sin(xCoarse);
% Imagine, for the sake of this 
% problem, that these two vectors are data 
% that come from measurements, 
% and you are unaware that they come from 

% Your task is to calculate the first and 
% second derivatives in 5 different ways. 
% For many of these methods, we will need a 
% finer x vector. Create a fine x vector,
xFine = 0:0.01:5;
% The five methods for the derivatives are:

% 1) True Derivative
% The analytical solution to the first and 
% second derivative, evaluated on xFine. 

% Call the first derivative 
dydxtrue = 0;
% and second derivative 
d2ydx2true = 0;

% 2) Coarse Finite difference
% Use O(del(x)^2) accurate finite difference 
% schemes on the coarse data. 

% Call the derivatives 
dydxcoarse = 0;
% and 
d2ydx2coarse = 0;

% 3) Finite difference on “nearest” interpolation
% Using O(del(x)^2) accurate finite difference
% schemes on the coarse data interpolated 
% on xFine. Use the interp1 function with 
% the ‘nearest’ option. 

% Call the derivatives 
dydxnearest = 0;
% and 
d2ydx2nearest= 0;

% 4) Finite difference on linear interpolation
% Using O(del(x)^2) accurate finite difference 
% schemes on the coarse data interpolated 
% on xFine. Use the interp1 function with 
% the ‘linear’ option. 

% Call the derivatives 
dydxlinear = 0;
% and 
d2ydx2linear = 0;

% Create three plots:
% one for the function itself,
% For the plot of the function, 
% plot all 5 methods. 

% one for the first derivative, and 
% For the derivative, plot all except “nearest” 

% one for the second derivative. 
% For the second derivative, plot all except 
% the linear and spline interpolation. 


% Notice how the accuracy of the 
% interpolation methods degrades as 
% higher derivatives are taken. 

% For each plot, make sure when you plot 
% the coarse data you use a marker (like ‘o’) 
% instead of a line, since this is only 
% known at coarse locations.



%-------------Notes--------------------------------------------------------
% To make the plots and lines easier to 
% distinguish, I recommend using the 
% “legend” and “title” commands in Matlab.

% When option 1) above is unavailable 
% (i.e., the function is not known), 
%     and a derivative is needed, 

%     (2) is the most obvious option, 
%     but gives the derivative based only 
%     on the coarse data. 

%     With interpolation, we can get 
%     finer data, but the accuracy degrades 
%     quickly when we take higher derivatives.
%     This is an advantage of splines. 

%     With higher order polynomial 
%     interpolation, we can get even better 
%     results that remain accurate to 
%     higher derivatives.

%-------------Notes--------------------------------------------------------
% While the results here are specific 
%   to this problem, they generalize well 
%   so long as our data comes from a function 
%       which is infinitely differentiable 
%       (we can take its derivative as 
%       many times as we like), 
%       which is how most physical 
%       functions behave.
